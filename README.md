###  Evidence from URLhaus:

The malicious hash was also found on URLhaus, a platform that tracks malicious URLs and payloads. Below is an image of the URLhaus entry confirming the malicious nature of the payload:

The hash was initially identified using the website [http://andeluctabeach.net/Anage/network-exe](http://andeluctabeach.net/Anage/network-exe). This platform facilitated the discovery and extraction of the malicious hash from a suspicious payload.

2 **Containment/Isolation**:  

   The first step in addressing the threat was isolating the affected system to prevent further compromise. This was done using **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**, which allowed for the quick containment of the infected device from the network.

5. **Review Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:  
   - Checked the reputation of the senderâ€™s email address and the malicious URL through VirusTotal.
   - Cross-referenced hashes and identified known malicious activity.
